## Briefly about me:
Speaking about goals and aims, I wish to end up with owning a company that provides cyber security services to corporate clients. Nevertheless, I am very excited about programming in different languages too.
I have started my learning experience from C# coding language and .NET platform. After completing several modules in that field, I moved to learning front-end technologies and stuck to them. I adore sitting at nights and learning new technologies using new libraries and frameworks. Who doesn't?...

// Function to manipulate with data
async function getData(src, symbol, first_col, sec_col) {
    var response = await fetch(src);
    var data = await response.text();
    var table = data.split('\n').slice(1);

    table.forEach(row => {
        var columns = row.split(symbol);
        xLabels.push(columns[first_col]);
        yLabels.push(parseFloat(columns[sec_col]));
    });
};
